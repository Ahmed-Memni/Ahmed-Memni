## 🚀 About Me  
I am passionate about **Linux development, embedded systems, and Docker**. I enjoy working on low-level programming, optimizing system performance, and exploring new technologies in software and hardware integration.  

Currently, I’m **relearning web development from the ground up**, refining my frontend and backend skills to build modern, responsive applications.

## 🎉 Fun Fact  
I **love debugging more than coding**, even if it takes hours! My code lines might not always look structured, but I’m always **working on making them better**. When a project excites me, I can work **day and night non-stop** until I get it just right!
